# Linked-Allocation
OS Linked List Allocation implementation, The allocation methods define how the files are stored in the disk blocks , one of the main disk space or file allocation methods is Linked List Allocation.

Linked List allocation solves all problems of contiguous allocation. In linked list allocation, each file is considered as the linked list of disk blocks. However, the disks blocks allocated to a particular file need not to be contiguous on the disk. Each disk block allocated to a file contains a pointer which points to the next disk block allocated to the same file.
